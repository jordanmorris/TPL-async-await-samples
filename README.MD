# TPL & async/await code samples

## From the TPL and async/await Best Practices for the Busy Developer

These live samples are part of the [**TPL & async/await Best Practices Guide for the Busy Dev**](https://scalablenotions.wordpress.com/2015/05/02/tpl-and-asyncawait-best-practices-for-the-busy-developer/), on [https://scalablenotions.wordpress.com/](https://scalablenotions.wordpress.com/).

The versions of the samples in this branch are intended for use when presenting. The samples on the master branch are recommended for reference purposes.

The solution requires .Net 4.5 to compile, which you can get for free with Visual Studio Community Edition.
